# Bitcoin Indexer

An experiment in indexing Bitcoin, in Rust.


Query blocks using JsonRPC, dump them into Postgres. Handle
reorg detections.


WIP, Goals:

* check how much code is realistically necessary
* check how simple/complex can it be
* check Rust ecosystem support (`rust-bitcoin` mostly)
* check performance and see how much can it be optimized
* check unkown unknows and own knowledge
